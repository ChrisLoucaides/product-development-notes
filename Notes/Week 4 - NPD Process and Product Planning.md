## Product development process definition:**

- "A sequence of steps or activities which an enterprise employs to conceive, design, and commercialize a product."
- The design and implementation of the product development process vary between organizations.
- Some organizations may lack a structured or recorded process.

## Why do we need a structured product development process?

Advantages of a well-defined product development process include:

- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures that products meet predefined quality standards.
- **Coordination:** Facilitates collaboration among different teams and departments involved in the development process.
- **Planning:** Provides a structured framework for planning the various stages of product development.
- **Management:** Allows for effective management of resources, timelines, and budgets throughout the process.
- **Improvement:** Enables continuous improvement by identifying areas for enhancement in subsequent development cycles.
- **Avoiding Product Failure:** Helps mitigate risks and minimize the likelihood of product failure by following a
  systematic approach.

### A generic product development process

A well-defined product development process offers several advantages:

- **Quality Assurance:** By specifying phases and checkpoints, the process ensures the quality of the resulting product.
- **Coordination:** It facilitates collaboration among different teams and departments involved in the development
  process.
- **Planning:** The process provides a structured framework for planning various stages, helping manage resources,
  timelines, and budgets effectively.
- **Management:** It allows for effective management of the entire development process.
- **Improvement:** Identifying areas for enhancement in subsequent cycles enables continuous improvement.
- **Risk Mitigation:** By following a systematic approach, it helps mitigate risks and minimize the likelihood of
  product failure.


- Quality assurance: The development process specifies phases and checkpoints, ensuring quality.
- Milestones: Checkpoints along the way help ensure the quality of the resulting product.

- Coordination
    - a clearly articulated development process acts as a master plan which defines the roles of each of the players on
      the development team
    - This plan tells the members of the team when their contributions will be needed and who they will need to exchange
      information and materials with
- Planning
    - a development process contains natural milestones corresponding to the completion of each phase
    - The timing of these milestones anchors the schedule of the overall development project

- Management
    - a development process is a benchmark for assessing the performance of an ongoing development effort
    - by comparing the actual events to the established process, a manager can identify possible problem areas
- Improvement
    - the careful documentation of an organisation’s development process often helps to identify opportunities for
      improvement

- Product development starts with planning and concludes with product launch.
- A generic product development process can be used as an example.
- The process can be divided into six distinct phases:
    0. Planning
    1. Concept development
    2. System-level design
    3. Detail design
    4. Testing and refinement
    5. Production ramp-up

## A generic product development process

### 0. Planning

- Often referred to as “phase zero”.
- It precedes the project approval and launch of the actual product development process.
- Begins with corporate strategy – includes an assessment of technology developments and market objectives.
- The output of this phase is the Project Mission Statement.
    - Project Mission Statement – specifies the target market for the product, business goals, key assumptions and
      constraint

### 1. Concept development

- The needs of the target market are identified.
- Alternative product concepts are generated and evaluated.
- One or more concepts are selected for further development and testing.
- Evaluation and screening criteria are used to aid in the selection.
- A concept is a description of the form, function, and features of a product.
- Usually accompanied by a set of specifications, an analysis of competitive products, and an economic justification for
  the project.

### 2. System-level design

- Includes the definition of the product architecture and the decomposition of the product into subsystems and
  components.
- The output of this phase usually includes:
    - A geometric layout of the product.
    - A functional specification of each of the product's subsystems.
    - A preliminary process flow diagram for the final assembly process.

### 3. Detail design

- Includes the complete specification of the geometry, materials, and tolerances of all the unique parts of the product.
- Also includes any information regarding parts to be purchased from suppliers.
- The output of this phase is the control documentation – the drawings or computer files describing the specifications
  of each of the parts of the product and how it is to be assembled.
- Two critical issues addressed in the detail design phase are:
    - Production cost.
    - Robust performance.

### 4. Testing and refinement

- Involves the construction and evaluation of multiple pre-production versions of the product – prototypes, GUI designs,
  etc.
- Initial testing within the organization.
- Further customer testing will be carried out at this stage – usually with the lead customer.
- Feedback used to make improvements and adjustments to the products.

## 5. Production ramp-up

- The product is made using the intended production system (this is relevant for both hardware and software).
- Purpose of the ramp-up is to train the workforce and to work out any remaining problems in the production process.
- Products from this phase are often delivered to preferred customers for initial feedback – changes may be incorporated
  into the final product.
- At some point during this phase, the product is launched and therefore available for widespread distribution.

## A generic product development process and decisions

- At the end of each phase, a decision will be made as to whether to proceed with development or not.
- Going straight to widespread distribution with a poor quality product, which is costly to produce, could cause many
  problems for the organization.
- Costs can be reduced using early evaluation.

## A generic product development process - in depth

### Phase 0 - Product Planning

- This phase takes place before a product development project is formally approved.
- It occurs before substantial resources are applied.
- It happens before the larger development team is formed.
- Product planning is an activity that:
    - Considers the portfolio of projects that an organization might pursue.
    - Determines what mix of new products and markets to develop, whether the focus is on basic or applied research, or
      diversification projects.
    - Determines what subset of these projects will be pursued over what time period.
    - Identification of the set of potential projects an organization might pursue.
- Ideas can come from multiple sources:
    - Marketing.
    - Research.
    - Current product development teams.
    - Benchmarking of competitors.
- Deciding which of these is most desirable.
- A portfolio of projects is selected.
- Timing is outlined.
- Resources are allocated.
- Launching each project with a focused mission.

#### Types of Projects (Phase 0)

It is useful to understand that there are four types of Product Development Projects

- 1: New Product Platforms:
    - Major development effort.
    - New family of products created (common platform).
    - Product family addresses familiar markets and product categories.
    - Example: Microsoft Windows, Nike+.

- 2: Derivatives of existing product platforms:
    - Projects extend an existing product platform.
    - This extension better addresses familiar markets with one or two more products.

-
    3. Incremental improvements to existing products:

    - May only involve adding or modifying some features of existing products.
    - This keeps the product line current and competitive.
    - The improvements could be solutions to problems, e.g. software bugs.

-
    4. Fundamentally new products:

    - Projects of radically different products or production technologies.
    - May address new markets or unfamiliar markets.
    - Much higher risk associated with this type of project.
    - This risk is somewhat outweighed by the benefit as this type of project can provide long-term success.
    - E.g. Apple’s first iPhone.

### The 5-step product planning process

- The process
- Ulrich and Eppinger identify a five-step planning process for Product planning.
- These 5 stages enable the organization to identify the Product Plan and Mission Statements (i.e., the outputs of this
  phase).

![[Pasted image 20240513132637.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240513132655.png]]

- The product plan will continue to be re-evaluated frequently.
- Re-evaluation may be initiated by further information obtained from development teams, research laboratories,
  production, marketing, and service organizations.
- Often, those not involved in the early stages of a project can identify potential problem areas or inconsistencies as
  they are new to the project.

- The planning process, depicted as linear in the diagram, is iterative.
- Reassessment of priorities and further refinement of project concepts, including removal, continues to take place in
  this phase.

#### Step 1 – identify opportunities

- First stage: Identify product development opportunities.
- Utilize the opportunity funnel to consolidate inputs from various organizational sources.
- Ideas for new products can originate from:
    - Marketing and sales personnel.
    - Research and technology development organizations.
    - Current product development teams.
    - Manufacturing and operations organizations.
    - Current or potential customers.
    - Third parties such as suppliers, inventors, and business partners.

- Opportunities can be identified through passive or proactive means:
    1. Passive identification involves gathering information without direct engagement.
    2. Proactive identification includes:
        - Documenting frustrations and complaints from current customers regarding existing products.
        - Interviewing lead users to uncover innovations and modifications they have made to existing products.

![[Pasted image 20240513132913.png]]

- Consider implications of trends in lifestyles, demographics, and technology for:
    - Existing product categories.
    - Opportunities for new product categories.
- Systematically gather suggestions from current customers, possibly through:
    - The sales force.
    - Customer service systems.
- Carefully study competitors' products on an ongoing basis.


- Track the status of emerging technologies to facilitate transfer from basic research into product development.
- Continuously collect ideas through the opportunity funnel, allowing for the emergence of new product ideas at any
  time.

- Expand each idea into a short description, including the potential business opportunity.
- Store and revisit these ideas later.
- Assign a 'champion' to each idea, responsible for supporting it through the process.

#### Step 2 – evaluate and prioritise projects

- Evaluate and analyze each project to decide which to pursue.
- Utilize four perspectives for evaluation:
    - Competitive strategy.
    - Market segmentation.
    - Technological trajectories.
    - Product platforms.

- Competitive strategy is a fundamental aspect of the overall corporate strategy.
- The strategy chosen depends on the objectives and mission statement of the organization.

- Ulrich and Eppinger identify four potential competitive strategies an organization could follow.
- The strategies are as follows:
    1. Technology Leadership:
        - Focus on basic research and development of new technologies.
        
    1. Cost Leadership:
        - Competitive focus on production efficiency to obtain the best economies of scale.
        
	3. Customer Focus:
		- The organization works closely with customers to assess changing needs and preferences.

	4. Imitative (Market Follower):
	- Strategy involves closely following market trends.
	- Allows competitors to enter the market first as market leaders.
	- When a clear opportunity has been identified and proven successful, the organization launches a competitive version.
	- This is a less risky strategy in a new technology development environment.

- Market Segmentation:
  - Involves the identification of weaknesses in the organization’s market and product portfolio.

- Technological Trajectories:
  - Involves determining when to adopt a new technology.
  - Deciding when to shift to the implementation of the new technology as part of the core product range.
  - Example: Kodak transitioning from 35mm film to APS to Digital.
  - Deciding when to retire old technologies.

![[Pasted image 20240513133806.png]]

- Product Platform Planning:
  - Involves the planning of the product platform, which refers to the set of assets shared across a range of products.
  - An effective platform enables the creation of derivative products more rapidly and easily.
  - Each product can offer features and functions tailored to specific market segments.
  - Platform development projects typically require 2–10 times more time and money compared to derivative products, leading to a low number of such projects.
  - Example: Microsoft Windows serves as a product platform.

![[Pasted image 20240513134015.png]]

- Evaluation Criteria for New Markets or Technologies:
  - Market size: Calculated by multiplying the number of units sold per year by the average price.
  - Market growth rate: Indicates the percentage increase in market size per year.
  - Competitive intensity: Assessed by considering the number of competitors and their strengths in the market.
  - Depth of firm's existing knowledge: Evaluates the extent of the organization's understanding of the market.
  
- Evaluation Criteria for New Markets or Technologies:
  - Market size: Calculated by multiplying the number of units sold per year by the average price.

  - Competitive intensity: Assessed by considering the number of competitors and their strengths in the market.
  - Depth of firm's existing knowledge: Evaluates the extent of the organization's understanding of the market.

- Evaluation Criteria and Screening Matrix:
  - Criteria such as market size, growth rate, competitive intensity, and existing knowledge are applicable to all product opportunities.
  - A Screening Matrix is employed to evaluate each opportunity based on these criteria.
  - The matrix aids in identifying the most suitable opportunities for the organization.
  - It is commonly utilized during the concept selection stage.
  - Additional resources, including an example of a Screening Matrix, can be accessed through 'extra material' on QM+.
#### Step 3 – allocate resources and plan timing
- Resource Allocation and Project Timing:
  - Organizations typically cannot invest in every product development opportunity due to constraints like human and physical resources.
  - These constraints determine the number and type of projects that can be undertaken.
  - This step involves:
    - Resource Allocation: Determining how resources will be distributed among various projects.
    - Project Timing: Establishing the timing for each project based on resource availability and strategic priorities.

- Resource Allocation:
  - Overcommitment of resources can lead to a drop in productivity.
  - Example: Allocating engineers and managers to more than one project, especially when they are already at full capacity with existing projects.

- Aggregate Planning:
  - Pursuing only projects feasible within the budgeted resources.
  - Leads to more efficient resource utilization.
  - Human resources, such as engineers and developers, are the primary resource for a project.
  - Resource management is typically expressed in person-hours or person-months.

- Resource Allocation:
  - Assessing the duration of each development phase to determine:
    - Required human resources.
    - Duration of commitment to the activity, affecting availability for alternative tasks.
  - Critical resources include:
    - Development equipment.
    - Test equipment.
    - Manufacturing capacity.
    - Availability of raw materials and components.

- Capacity Utilization Ratio:
  - Greater than 100% utilization indicates insufficient resources to execute all planned projects on schedule.
  - Less than 100% utilization indicates the ability to execute all planned projects on schedule.
  - Less than 90% utilization:
    - Consider adding additional projects.
    - Consider reducing completion time.
    - Consider removing some resources to increase project efficiency.
  - Ideally, aiming for around 95% utilization allows for unforeseen problems.

- Project Timing:
  - Determining the timing and sequence of projects, also known as pipeline management, involves considering several factors:
    1. Timing of product introductions (or Time to Market, TTM):
       - Bringing a product to market sooner is advantageous.
       - However, launching a product before it meets quality standards can harm reputation.
    2. Technology readiness:
	  - A proven, robust technology can be integrated into products much more quickly and reliably.
	3. Market readiness:
	  - The sequence of product introductions determines whether early adopters buy the low-end product and may trade up or whether they buy the high-end product offered at a high initial price.
	  - Releasing improvements too quickly can frustrate customers who want to keep up (e.g., PC market).
	  - Releasing them too slowly can risk competition.
	4. Competition
	  - The anticipated release of competing products may accelerate the timing of development projects

##### Time to Market (TTM) vs. Flexible NPD process?
- Flexible product development:
  - Ability to make changes to the product being developed or in how it is developed, even relatively late in the development process, without being too disruptive.
  - Later changes imply greater flexibility, while less disruptive changes enhance flexibility.
  - Change can be expected in:
    - Customer preferences and usage patterns.
    - Competitors' responses.
    - Applied technologies in the product or its manufacturing process.

#### Step 4 – complete pre-project planning
- Pre-project planning:
  - Occurs after project approval but before resource commitment.
  - Involves a small, cross-functional team called the Core Team.

- Mission statement creation:
  - Occurs during this step.
  - Provides clear guidance for the product development organization.
  - Includes:
    - A brief description of the product.
      - Typically one sentence.
      - Highlights the key customer benefit.
      - Avoids implying a specific product concept.
    - Could be the product vision statement.

- Key business goals:
  - Support the corporate strategy.
  - Include goals for:
    - Time:
      - Timing for product introduction.
    - Cost:
      - Desired financial performance.
    - Quality.
    - Target market for the product.
      - Primary and secondary markets to consider in the development effort.

- Assumptions and constraints guiding the development effort.
- Stakeholders:
  - List all product stakeholders to address subtle development issues.
  - Reminder for the team to consider the needs of everyone influenced by the product.

- Project staffing and leadership considerations.
- Key development staff "sign up" for new projects.
- Agreement to commit to leading the project or critical elements.
- Establishment of budgets during pre-project planning.


#### Reflect on the results and the process

- Reflection to assess the quality of the process and results.
- Questions to consider:
  - Is the opportunity funnel collecting an exciting and diverse set of product opportunities?
  - Does the product plan support the competitive strategy of the firm?
  - Does the product plan address the most important current opportunities facing the firm?
  - Are the total resources allocated to product development sufficient to pursue the firm's competitive strategy?

- Consideration of creative resource leveraging methods such as:
  - Use of product platforms
  - Joint ventures
  - Partnerships with suppliers
- Does the core team acknowledge and embrace the challenges outlined in the mission statement?
- Is there consistency among the elements of the mission statement?

- Are the assumptions listed in the mission statement truly necessary, or is the project overly constrained?
- Will the development team have the freedom to innovate and create the best possible product?
- What improvements can be made to the product planning process?

- Are the assumptions listed in the mission statement truly necessary, or is the project overly constrained?
- Will the development team have the freedom to innovate and create the best possible product?
- What improvements can be made to the product planning process?
