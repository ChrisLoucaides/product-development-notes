## Business Strategy

- Definition (Chandler, 1962):
  - "... the determination of the basic long-term goals and objectives of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals”

## Strategy
- Strategy is a key element in management
- There are 3 big strategic questions to ask…
  - Where are we?
  - What’s next?
  - How do we get there?

## Strategies at different levels
- International strategic management can be very complex
- Because of this, many global companies develop global strategies at different levels


## Strategy Hierarchy
- Corporate level
  - What business the company should be in
  - Culture and leadership structure/style of company
  - Particularly important when mergers take place
- Business level
  - Competition
  - Value generation
  - Sustainable competitive advantage


## Corporate Strategy
Definition: “Identification of the purpose of the organisation and the plans and actions to achieve that purpose”


## Business (unit) strategy
- Corporate strategy deals with the overall organization
- but business strategy focuses on specific businesses, subsidiaries, or operating units
- This involves careful consideration of its purpose, its resources, and how it interacts with the environment in which it operates
  - Business strategy is a means by which long-term objectives are achieved
  - Business strategy is sometimes called ‘business unit strategy’ or ‘functional strategy

- Business strategies include:
  - Marketing strategies
  - New product development strategies
  - Human resource strategies
  - Financial strategies
  - Legal strategies
  - Supply-chain strategies
  - Information technology management strategies

## Business Strategies
- Some Examples:
  - Geographic expansion
  - Diversification
  - Merger & Acquisition
  - Market penetration
  - Retrenchment
  - Liquidation
  - Joint venture

## Essential Marketing Concepts
### Needs, Wants & Demands  
- Human need: a state of deprivation that you feel
- Human want: the form that a human need takes as shaped by culture and individual personality
- Demand: human wants that are backed by buying power

### Markets
- Markets: the set of all actual and potential buyers of a product or service

### Products, Services
- Definition of Product:
  - “Anything that can be offered to a market for attention, acquisition, use or consumption that might satisfy a want or need. It includes physical objects, services, persons, places, organizations and ideas”
  - “Services are products that consist of activities, benefits or satisfactions that are offered for sale and are essentially intangible”

### 3 Levels of Product Differentiation
There are three levels on which products can be differentiated:

1. Core product – definition:
   - “The problem-solving services or core benefits that consumers are really buying when they obtain a product”
   - The essential basics needed to compete in a product market
   - e.g., a PC needs to be able to run software and display the results

2. Actual Product – definition:
   - “A product’s parts, quality level, features, design, brand name, packaging and other attributes that combine to deliver core product benefits”

3. Augmented product – definition:
   - “Additional consumer services and benefits built around the core and actual products” [9]
   - Offers features, services, or benefits that go beyond normal expectations
   - e.g., free installation, free broadband connection for a year, etc.
   - An additional category highlighted by Levitt (1986) [10]
   - Potential product – includes all of the features and services that could be envisaged as beneficial to customers, i.e., what can be used to differentiate the product next?

![[Pasted image 20240512221737.png]]


Where does the distinction lie between each of these? What makes something augmented over expected? e.g. mobile phone with camera

Competition drives up consumer expectations Market leaders produce augmented products Market followers see a positive response and also produce augmented products Consumers then expect augmentation as standard Companies then have to create new services etc to differentiate their products

BUT – this may leave a gap in the market for ‘no frills’ products


### New Product Development  (NPD)

What is NPD? 

New Product Development (NPD) is the process of conceptualizing, designing, and bringing new products or services to market. It involves the identification of market opportunities, the generation of ideas, and the transformation of those ideas into tangible products or services that meet customer needs. 

- “For many people, new products are the outputs of the innovation process, where the new product development (NPD) process is a sub-process of innovation” [1]
- “Managing innovation concerns the conditions that have to be in place to ensure that the organisation as a whole is given the opportunity to develop new products”
- “The actual development of new products is the process of transforming business opportunities into tangible products”

- Where does the focus for New Product Development (NPD) come from?
- What drives investment into one area over another?
- What are the considerations that are taken in order to define the NPD strategy?

## Considerations for NPD Strategies
### Corporate Strategies
There are several factors to consider when planning a new product strategy:
1. On-going corporate strategy:
  - In large organisations, this is a formal activity involving strategic planners who set the future direction of the business.
  - In smaller organisations, this is usually carried out by the owner in a more ad-hoc way.
  - Such considerations are usually long-term.


### On-going market planning
2.  On-going market planning:
    - The launch of a new product by a competitor, or a newly identified customer demand, could lead to the creation of specific new product development teams.
    - These teams may be focused on individual aspects of a new product in order to create a better product and obtain competitive advantage.


### Technology Management
3. On-going technology management:
  - A continual analysis of internal R&D and trawling of external technology is needed to identify new product development opportunities.
  - For example, a patent review may identify that a competitor is working on a new product. The organization may then have to create a NPD team to work on a competing product – perhaps with the aim of being the first to the market.
  - This is an example of competitive intelligence gathering and proactive response in new product development.


## Opportunity Analysis

4. Opportunity analysis
- New inventions can be discovered without any planning – these have to be exploited in the right way.
- NPD teams are created to identify a potential product for an invention.
- Technology-Push compared to Market-Pull.
  - i.e. Applications Engineering (see Topic 2).

## Business Growth - Ansoff's growth matrix

- Characteristics of an Innovative Organisation:
  - Growth Orientation.
- Ansoff’s Growth Matrix:
  - New Product Development (NPD) can be used as a strategy for growth.
  - Ansoff’s directional policy matrix is a tool that can be used by organisations to identify the variety of growth options available to them.
  - This is also known as the ‘Product-Market’ growth matrix.

![[Pasted image 20240512222905.png]]

- Definition of Ansoff’s growth matrix:
  - "It is an analysis tool that allows organisations to consider ways to grow the business via existing and/or new products, in existing and/or new markets" [wikipedia].
  - The matrix (see next slide) combines two of the key variables that enable a business to grow:
    - An increase in market opportunities.
    - An increase in product opportunities.


![[Pasted image 20240512222949.png]]

- Each of the four cells considers various combinations of product-market options.
- Growth can be achieved in two ways:
  - Organic – i.e. internal development.
  - External acquisition.

### Market Penetration
- Covers current markets/current products.
- Opportunities are said to exist within a business’s existing markets through increasing the volume of sales of existing products.
- Utilising the marketing mix to look for ways to increase market penetration is a common approach.
  - e.g. a different way or time for customers to use your products.
- Gain greater market share, i.e. gain competitors’ customers.


### Market Development
- Covers current products/new markets.
- Growth opportunities are said to exist for a business’s products through making them available to new markets.
  - e.g. using existing products in new geographical markets.
  - e.g. selling your existing products to a new age group of customers.
- Keeps the security of handling existing products.

### Product Development Strategy
- Covers new products/current markets.
- Offering new or improved products to existing markets.
- Frequently, when a firm creates new products, it can gain new customers for these products.
- New product development can be a crucial business development strategy for firms to stay competitive.
- This is the focus of this lecture.

### Diversification
- Covers new products/new markets.
- Moving into new markets, potentially with a base from your existing product knowledge or diversification through acquisition of other companies.
- For example, the Virgin group has used its respected brand name to diversify.
- Started in the music business.
- Is now in travel, leisure, telecoms, health, finance, shopping.


## Ansoff’s growth matrix and risk

![[Pasted image 20240512223614.png]]

- The element of risk increases the further the strategy moves away from known quantities - the existing product and the existing market.
- Product development (requiring, in effect, a new product) and market extension (a new market) involve a greater risk than penetration.
- Diversification (both new products and new markets) generally carries the greatest risk of all.

## A problem with Ansoff’s growth matrix
- A major criticism of this matrix is that it is based on the assumption that opportunities for growth will exist – they may not.
- Often consolidation and reduction of expenditure need to be considered, especially in times of economic downturn – the matrix does not allow for these situations.


## Product Failure
- Identification of appropriate projects to be developed into products is vital.
- Many studies have been carried out and the rate of failure given ranges from 10-90% of new products.
- Acceptance that some ideas are not commercially viable or organizationally appropriate is very important in order to ensure that unnecessary investment is avoided.
- However, even after rigorous continual assessment, some products that are launched to the market still fail.


## Reasons for product failure
- Many reasons are given for product failure:
  - The product offers nothing new or no improved performance.
  - Inadequate budget to develop ideas or market the product.
  - Poor market research, positioning, misunderstanding of customers' needs.
  - Lack of top management support.
  - Did not involve customers.
  - Exceptional factors such as government decisions.
  - Market too small, either due to forecasting errors with sales or insufficient demand.
  - Poor match with the company’s capabilities; the company has insufficient experience of the technology or market.
  - Inadequate support from a channel.
  - Late to market.
  - Competitive response was strong, and competitors were able to move quickly to face the challenge of the new product.
  - Internal organizational problems, often associated with poor communication.
  - Poor return on investment forcing the company to abandon the project.
  - Unexpected changes in consumer tastes or fashion.

## Avoiding failure
- An analysis of the common failure modes reveals the root causes of failure.
- Process improvements and a structured approach can address these common failure themes. For example:
  - Better requirements capture and management.
  - Better planning, including getting to the market on time and first if market leader.
  - Better analysis and screening.
  - Organization-wide process framework.
  - Better execution.
- This means we need a structured development process.


## Characteristics of successful product development
- To assess whether or not a product development has been a success, the characteristics on the next few slides are evaluated at the end of each project.
- This is usually done at the post-project "wrap-up" meeting.
- This helps the management of a "for-profit" organization to make decisions on the next project.
- The answers to these questions, whether the project was a success or failure, can provide fundamental information to organizations to help make decisions on NPD in the future.

![[Pasted image 20240512224252.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240512224306.png]]

- Positive answers to these questions will show that the project was successful.
- Often, the success factors of this project will be considered and replicated in future projects to ensure continual success in product development.
- Failures can also be learned from; mistakes can be avoided to reduce the chance of future product failure.
- Of course, every project is different, and other elements such as external and internal factors will have to be considered.

## The key departments in product development

- **Marketing:**
  - Mediates the interactions between the firm and its customers, i.e., communication.
  - Identifies possible products, market segments, customer needs, etc.

- **Design (R&D):**
  - Plays the lead role in defining the physical form of the product and how this can best meet customer needs.
  - This may be in the form of hardware, software, electronics, etc.

- **Manufacturing:**
  - Design and operation of the production of the product.
  - Often includes supply chain management.

## Project  Teams

- **Project teams:**
  - Created with representatives from each of these areas.
  - Made up of:
    - **Core team:** Usually with a team leader and one representative from each of the areas involved in the stages from product conception to delivery.
    - **Extended team:** All of the people involved in the development (multiple team members, etc.).
