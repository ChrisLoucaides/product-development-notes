## Issues of successful innovation

- There are considerations that organizations need to make to ensure their innovation strategy is successful
- This further develops the characteristics of innovative organizations given in Topic 1
- A key consideration is the successful management of uncertainty. This is related to two of the characteristics:
  - Acceptance of risks
  - Adaptability

### Acceptance of risks
- The willingness to invest in the long-term development of technology
- The willingness to include risky opportunities in a balanced portfolio

## Adaptability
- A readiness to accept change

## Managing uncertainty
- There are two key aspects to uncertainty:
  - Uncertainty about the ends (i.e., what is the eventual target of the project)
  - Uncertainty about the means (how to achieve this project target)
- Pearson (1991) created the Uncertainty Map
- This provides a framework for the analysis and understanding of uncertainty and the innovation process

## The Uncertainty Map
- Developed following extensive analysis of case studies of major technological innovations, including:
  - Pilkington’s float glass process
  - 3M’s post-it notes
  - Sony’s Walkman
- A great deal of uncertainty surrounded these and other projects
- If it is new technology
  - How can this be developed into a product?
- Or, if a product opportunity has been identified (perhaps through market research, therefore market pull) how will this product be produced?

## Quadrant 1 - Exploratory Research
- Activities with a high level of uncertainty
- ‘Blue sky’ research
  - Often carried out in university research groups – sometimes with collaboration or support from industry
  - Technology is not fully understood
  - Products or market for the research have not been identified
- Example of organizational investment in exploratory research – Microsoft Corporate Campus, Seattle - [Link](http://members.microsoft.com/careers/mslife/locations/corpcampus.mspx)

## Quadrant 2 – development engineering
- The end target of the project is clear, e.g., the marketing department may have identified a market opportunity through market research, customer liaison, etc.
- The means of how to achieve this has not been identified
- Often organizations will create several small project groups to work on solutions
- Each group will be expected to identify solutions that have to be ‘sold’ to management teams
- Often only 1 in 5 project ideas make it to production
- New ways of achieving the opportunity may arise during development
- Therefore the uncertainty level is high
- Often used in manufacturing for identifying improved methods that may reduce cost – i.e., production process innovation

## Quadrant 3 – applications engineering
- More certainty on how the business will achieve the target (also for Quadrant 4)
- Therefore, it is likely the technology has been used before
- Uncertainty is focused around the end product itself
  - i.e., how can a technology that has been identified and understood within an organization be used as a product?
- Technology is applied to different products – not every product will be used, they may be ineffective due to cost or performance
- However, some products may still be identified from this process
  - E.g., the eventual use of Spencer Silver’s adhesive in Post-it Notes

## Quadrant 4 – combining market opportunities with technical capabilities

- Innovative activities where there is most certainty
  - i.e., improving existing products
  - Or new products are created through combining existing technical capability and proven market opportunities
- Competition is fierce in this area – speed of development and product release is essential
- New product designs, with little technical changes, can dramatically improve the appeal of a product
  - e.g., Apple’s continually creating new handsets with new designs which lead to market leadership


## The Uncertainty map and skill mixes 
- The uncertainty map gives the management of an organization a view as to the type of group manager and individuals that should be employed dependent on the amount of uncertainty
- i.e., Quadrant 1 requires an equal focus between technology and commercial managers. Given the high level of uncertainty, the skills of both these managers need to be utilized in order to identify both the project ends (e.g., a product and application of a technology) and the means to achieve those ends

## Managing uncertainties – skill sets
- Quadrant 2 would require project-management skills – the ability to identify when a project should be supported and encouraged to deliver or cancelled in order to avoid escalating costs
- Quadrant 3 would require technology managers and those who are market focused - as the aim is to identify which markets to enter with an identified technology
- Quadrant 4 would consist of a team that were product and market focused – being able to forecast what existing products could be updated to capture any market opportunities

## The right organisational structure for innovation
- The majority of the literature agrees that the right organizational structure to support and encourage innovation is ‘organic’ (Burns & Stalker (1961) taken from Trott pg. 92)
- As opposed to overly structured, known as ‘Mechanistic’ 
- An organic organization can be described as having:
  - Channels of communication – which are open with free information flow throughout the organization
  - Operating styles – which are allowed to vary freely
  - Authority for decisions – which are based on the expertise of the individual
  - Free-adaptation – by the organization to changing circumstances
  - Emphasis on getting things done – unconstrained by the requirements of the situation and personality of the individual doing the job
  - Loose informal control – with emphasis on norm of cooperation
  - Flexible on-job behavior – permitted to be shaped by the requirements of the situation and personality of the individual doing the job
  - Decision-making – participation and group consensus used frequently
  - i.e., development of the characteristics:
    - Growth orientation
    - Commitment to technology
    - ‘slack’
    - Cross-functional cooperation

- The right organizational structure should include a mix of the key roles identified in the next slide
- Each of these roles is key to supporting innovation and specific projects and staff
- Research has identified that these roles show that innovation is a ‘people process’ and that getting the right mix is key to success

## Establishing and encouraging an innovative environment
- “Developing a reputation for innovation helps to propagate a virtuous circle that reinforces a company’s abilities”
- The concept of the virtuous circle is an example of Porter’s notion of competitive advantage
  - i.e., Porter argued that if an organization had competitive advantage in an industry, any additional profit gained from this position was reinvested in the activities that gave it that competitive advantage in the first place, thereby continuing this position

![[Pasted image 20240512180355.png]]

- Reputation of the organization
- Some organizations are regarded as more innovative than others
- Top innovative company in the world (see webinar slides)
- Attraction of creative people
- Creative people are attracted to organizations that they perceive to be innovative (this can be helped by the reputation of the organization)

- Organization encourages creativity
- Must provide time for people to be creative
- Allow slack in project timescales for innovation
- Build an environment that tolerates errors and mistakes – thereby encouraging people to try new things and take risks
- Encourage an environment where people feel confident in putting forward new ideas and suggestions and also asking questions
- These ideas could also be rewarded

- Development of innovative products
- Developing products that are a genuine improvement to those available
- Success in the marketplace often leads to further success
- A willingness to accept new ideas
- Vital that a new idea, once accepted, is taken through to completion

- Increased motivation and reduced frustration
- If employees see that their contributions are impacting on the success of an organization, they are further motivated, they can see their individual value immediately
- If good ideas are overlooked or even ‘stolen’ by the organization, motivation will drop and creative people are lost

- High morale and retention of creative people
- All of the above will contribute to the morale of the people within an organization. This, in turn, will increase retention as employees feel rewarded and their jobs are enjoyable


## Product Life Cycles:

- Introduction/Launch:
  - Advertising and promotion campaigns
  - Target campaign at specific audience?
  - Monitor initial sales
  - Maximize publicity
  - High cost/low sales
  - Length of time – type of product

- Growth:
  - Increased consumer awareness
  - Sales rise
  - Revenue increases
  - Costs - fixed costs/variable costs, profits may be made
  - Monitor market – competitors' reaction?

- Maturity:
  - Sales reach peak
  - Cost of supporting the product declines
  - Ratio of revenue to cost high
  - Sales growth likely to be low
  - Market share may be high
  - Competition likely to be greater
  - Price elasticity of demand?
  - Monitor market – changes/amendments/new strategies?

- Saturation:
  - New entrants likely to mean market is ‘flooded’
  - Necessity to develop new strategies becomes more pressing:
    - Searching out new markets:
      - Linking to changing fashions
      - Seeking new or exploiting market segments
    - Linking to joint ventures – media/music, etc.
    - Developing new uses
    - Focus on adapting the product
    - Re-packaging or format
    - Improving the standard or quality
    - Developing the product range

- Decline and Withdrawal:
  - Product outlives/outgrows its usefulness/value
  - Fashions change
  - Technology changes
  - Sales decline
  - Cost of supporting starts to rise too far
  - Decision to withdraw may be dependent on availability of new products and whether fashions/trends will come around again?

## The BCG Matrix
- The BCG Matrix:
  - A means of analyzing the product portfolio and informing decision making about possible marketing strategies
  - Developed by the Boston Consulting Group – a business strategy and marketing consultancy in 1968
  - Links growth rate, market share, and cash flow

![[Pasted image 20240512181055.png]]


• Like SWOT Analysis, it is a useful aid to strategy formation which can highlight important strategic issues, but it only provides one piece of the jigsaw. 

• It is particularly revealing in how current success can mask future dangers. 

• Market share is a relative (not absolute) concept.

• The key balance in the portfolio will be between the ‘cash cows’ and the ‘question marks’ AKA problem children. 

• ‘Dogs’ and ‘Stars’ tend to be minor winners or losers.


## Implications of the BCG Matrix:

- Dogs:
  - Are they worth persevering with?
  - How much are they costing?
  - Could they be revived in some way?
  - How much would it cost to continue to support such products?
  - How much would it cost to remove from the market?

- Problem Children (?s):
  - What are the chances of these products securing a hold in the market?
  - How much will it cost to promote them to a stronger position?
  - Is it worth it?

- Stars:
  - Huge potential
  - May have been expensive to develop
  - Worth spending money to promote
  - Consider the extent of their product life cycle in decision making

- Cash Cows:
  - Cheap to promote
  - Generate large amounts of cash – use for further R&D?
  - Costs of developing and promoting have largely gone
  - Need to monitor their performance – the long term?
  - At the maturity stage of the PLC?
