## Innovation

Innovative ideas = products, or not...
- this course is all about identifying innovative ideas that may be turned into products

- Most large companies contain R&D divisions
	- Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, GSK, Phillips, etc

- There is constant research into the next potential product to increase turnover and profit
- Think of some examples
	- What companies have been very successful with innovative products? (Google, Meta, Cisco, Tesla...)

## The Innovation Funnel

There is more failure than success! The rewards of success can be great!

## Product development in a large business

- Several stages involved in product development within a large company
- This course will highlight and investigate many of these
- Advantage of development in a large company
  - More resources, more money
- Disadvantage
  - Lots of stages and departments to complete, therefore difficult to make decisions or create products quickly

## Why products aren't developed...

- Possible reasons include:
  - Technically too difficult
  - Too expensive to take to production
  - Insufficient resources to take to production
  - Not enough customer demand
  - Not enough scope for a large profit
  - Concept does not fit Corporate Image or Corporate Strategy


## Starting a new business with a new product

- The first step after identifying an innovation and therefore a potential product is to create a business plan/feasibility study
- Need finance and resources to create a product
- Advantage of a Start-up business
  - Can react quickly when they have an innovative idea, especially if there is customer demand
  - Therefore can be a threat to large companies
- Disadvantage
  - Lack of finance, lack of resource
  - Often fail as owners are very good technically, but do not have project management, marketing, sales and financial skills required

## Innovation?

What do you understand by the term "innovation" ?
- "Innovation is the management of all the activities involved in the process of idea generation, technology development, manufacturing and marketing of a new (or improved) product or manufacturing process or equipment"
- Innovation is where an idea becomes reality
- Innovation is the practical application of new inventions into marketable products and services


## Invention?
What do you understand by the term ‘invention’?

- Invention – creation of something new/new idea or the formulation of new ideas for products or processes
- Can you think of someone who is a typical inventor, but not a quite successful innovator?


## Difference between Invention and Innovation?

Is there a difference? Differing opinions:
Innovation = theoretical conception + technical invention + commercial exploitation

An invention can still become an innovation even if it is unsuccessful, provided it made it to the marketplace


## Innovation
- Innovation management is not exclusively associated with products
- Innovations can fall into two main categories:
  - Product (or service) innovation
  - Process innovation
- There are also other categories that can be seen in the table on the next slides

## Types of innovation
![[Pasted image 20240512163914.png]]


## Product Innovation:
- In most cases, we think of innovation relating to actual products
	- New technologies
	- Leading edge products
	- Gadgets, etc
- Advantages of launching new or improved products onto the market include:
  - Increased market share
  - Public relations – e.g. news coverage
  - Enhanced reputation as an innovative company
  - Opportunity to build early customer loyalty
  - Added value
  - Higher prices and profitability
  - Competitive advantage

## Innovation (cont.)
- Product innovation can lead to process, management, and/or organizational innovation
- The digital cameras replacing film cameras, e.g., changes had to take place in manufacturing, marketing, sales, and repair functions:
  - Business focus shifted to digital cameras for the consumer market
  - Marketing staff were required for promotion and education of customers (and distributors)
  - Production of the cameras is different – new processes, equipment, and human skills
  - Complementary goods are different (i.e., memory cards instead of film)


## Process Innovation
- Has to do with finding more efficient and effective ways of
  - Producing existing products
  - Delivering existing products
  - Can also include producing or delivering new products where appropriate
- Advantages are
  - Reduced costs
  - Improved quality
  - More responsive customer service
  - Greater flexibility
- Disadvantages
  - Loss of jobs – especially if work is outsourced
  - Need for re-training of workers

### New services that also create new business models/value
![[Pasted image 20240512164817.png]]


## Models of innovation - what is the source?

- Serendipity
- Innovation luck? ‘Eureka!’
- Linear models (3 models)

1: Technology Push
![[Pasted image 20240512164930.png]]

2: Market Pull
![[Pasted image 20240512165000.png]]

3: Universities & industry liaison

Creation of new knowledge, dominated by universities and large science-based organisations

Technology development, dominated by organisations

Consumers express their needs and wants through the consumption of products

## Models of Innovation

### Simultaneous coupling
![[Pasted image 20240512165206.png]]

### Interactive
![[Pasted image 20240512165305.png]]

- This model takes simultaneous coupling one step further
- No explicit starting point
- Identified in 1980’s/1990’s by Rothwell and Zegveld
- They believed that society had an influence on innovation and vice versa [10]
- The diagram represents the links between the organization and its internal and external linkages with the marketplace and science base
- Organizations which can successfully manage this process will be the most successful innovators
- This diagram allows for feedback through the different stages of the development of innovations.

## The Cyclic Model of innovation with interconnected cycles
![[Pasted image 20240512165420.png]]

## What makes an innovative company?

- One answer could be that it is a company that has
- Incorporated an interactive model of innovation and
- Can be characterized by the features on the following slides

![[Pasted image 20240512165623.png]]

## Growth Orientation
- Growth orientation
- Not all companies' priority is for growth
- Often family-run companies want to stay the same size, thus remaining manageable without external intervention
- Innovative companies are those that wish to grow their business
- This is a long-term process, and investment is required
- Companies show this R&D investment in their company reports
- E.g. Apple, Microsoft, Siemens, others?

## What makes an innovative company? 

### Vigilance
- It is vital to be aware of what markets and competitors are doing
- SWOT analysis is an important tool
- Identifying threats, opportunities etc.
- Often carried out by marketing team, but should be encouraged in all departments at all levels
- R&D team University liaison
- Many companies have specific teams to monitor competition and opportunities

### Commitment to Technology
- Long-term commitment is needed and appropriate resources must be financed
- There is not always an immediate return on investment
- Some companies moved away from this during the IT/Telecoms recession
- Creativity is only seen in a climate of commitment to innovation
- Need to employ and retain innovative staff

### Acceptance of risks
- Not all investment in innovation will be realized in turnover or profit
- Not all inventions will become innovations
- Risk assessment strategies and balanced product portfolios are crucial to success
- The business strategy must consider risk and commitment

### Cross-functional cooperation
- Reduction/removal of inter-departmental conflict
- The biggest conflict is often between marketing and R&D functions
- Opinions differ over business objectives and the ability to commit to firm dates
- The marketing function does not always understand what is involved technically to create a product

### Receptivity
- The ability to accept technologies from outside of the company and use them to create new innovations
- It is very difficult to create everything ‘in-house’
- Strength to identify areas of focus
- Joint activities allow knowledge sharing
  - e.g. IBM, Microsoft joint activity to create mutually beneficial technology, including web services and creating industry standards

### Slack
- Allowing individuals time to think and investigate new technologies, etc.
- Some flexibility on milestones
- Encouragement for group discussions, attending conferences, etc.

### Adaptability
- Ability for companies to adapt as required
- Innovative products can lead to changes in processes, etc.
- Need to encourage a climate that accepts change
- Can be easier in smaller companies with fewer processes

### Diverse range of skills
- Ensuring that a company has a workforce with a diverse range of skills
- Important to have employees with the appropriate industry knowledge
- Good management knowledge and experience
- Strong overall team with the correct mix of skills and experience
