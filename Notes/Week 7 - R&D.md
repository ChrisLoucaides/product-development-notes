## Learning Objectives
- The importance of R&D
- The classifications of R&D
- The strategic role of R&D
- How funding is allocated to R&D activities

###  Companies with the highest spending on R&D

### Biggest R&D Investors among Companies

### What is R&D
- Research and experimental development (R&D) comprises creative and systematic work undertaken in order to:
    - Increase the stock of knowledge – including knowledge of humankind, culture, and society
    - Devise new applications of available knowledge

More important to some companies than others The R&D continuum (operations that make up R&D)

- Technology Explosion
- A large percentage of our technology knowledge has been generated lately (90% generated during past 60 years)
- Shortening of technology cycles
    - Includes both scientific and technological development prior to product life cycle. These are slowly shortening, forcing companies to focus on product development. (e.g. the production life-cycle of a car reduced from 10 years in 1960s to 5 years in 2020)
- Globalisation of technology
    - Growth of technology markets in east Asia. (resulted in a substantial increase in technology transfer in the form of licensing and strategic alliances)

Factors to consider:
- Environmental Forecasts
    - Changes in technology that will occur in the future as well as other PEST factors.
    - What will be the new competitive technologies and businesses?
- Comparative technological cost effectiveness
- Technology obsolescence – moving on to the next technology.
    - e.g.: electrical power technology for cars
- Risk – Culture of the organization for risk.
    - How risky are the proposals.
- Capability Analysis – Strengths and weaknesses of the organization.

### PEST Analysis
- Changes in the business environment can create great opportunities for the organization or cause significant challenges.
- PEST analysis helps you to analyze the Political, Economic, Socio-Cultural, and Technological changes in the business environment.
- You can gain a better understanding of the "big picture" forces of change that you're exposed to.

### Michaelporterfiveforces
- A model that identifies and analyzes five competitive forces that shape every industry.
- Helps determine an industry's weaknesses and strengths.
- Frequently used to identify an industry's structure to determine corporate strategy.
- To understand the level of competition within the industry and enhance a company's long-term profitability.

### Strategic Role of R&D
- R&D should not be independent of business strategy.
- R&D is part of the business support infrastructure.

### R&D Strategic Planning
- Core technologies
    - Central to all or most of the company’s products
    - e.g. Photographic technology in photocopy industry
- Complementary technologies
    - Additional technologies that are essential in product development
    - e.g. Paper handling technology, folding, stapling
- Peripheral technologies
    - Whose application contributes to the business.
    - e.g. Software to add features and security
- Emerging technologies
    - Adds long-term significance for its products
    - e.g. Telecommunication feature for product

### Technology Leverage and R&D Strategy
- There are two forms of activity for R&D department: growth and maintenance
- Within these two groups, it is possible to conduct significantly different types of activity.
- These categories can be subdivided into four groups.

### Classifying the level of research using Technology leverage

R&D for Growth:

- Survival
    - Conducted if the decision has been made to exit the business. In such circumstances, the role of R&D department is to ensure its interim survival against technology mishaps to process or product. This would be a reactive problem-solving role and maybe termed as survival research.
- Competitiveness
    - Intention is to sustain the business, the role of research shifts to maintaining the relative competitive technological position by making improvements to both product and process.
    - High research activity to maintain a high technology leverage position.
    - Failing in process technology or product would give a significant advantage to the competitor.

R&D for Maintenance:

- Technology Mastery
    - Incremental growth of a business in a strong position involves improving product and process relative to the competition. Requires a greater research effort than the competitor. Requires high R&D expenditure.
- Break the mould
    - If the aim is to create a technological advantage, then a much higher order of novelty and creativity required. Involve developing new patentable technology and may involve a higher level of basic scientific research.


### Key Factors to consider when allocating Funds to R&D Projects
- Expenditure by competitors
- Company’s long-term growth objectives
- Need for stability
- Distortions introduced by large projects

### Approaches that can be used for allocating funds to R&D
- Inter-firm comparisons
- A fixed relationship to turnover
- A fixed relationship to profits
- Reference to previous levels of expenditure
- Costing of an agreed programme
- Internal customer–contractor relationship

### Evaluating R&D Projects
- Large technology-intensive firms have many ideas that they would wish to fund as research projects
- The major and most common problem faced is the limitation of resources.
- Choices/decisions would have to be made about which projects to convert to R&D projects and which projects to drop.
- Dropping an R&D project is referred to as ‘killing a project’.


### Drop out rates for R&D Projects

### Evaluation Criteria
- Criteria used vary based on the industry and are different from one business to the other
- Most companies inform us that they use software-based DSS and other mathematical models for this decision making however, there is a high reliance on expert judgment
- Most organizations rely on rule of thumb and heuristics for the evaluation of projects.
