## Legal Aspects and Product Development
In many of the phases of the product development process, the Intellectual Property value of the concept, and then of the product, need to be considered

- This is especially the case in:
  - Phase 1 – Concept Development
    - Do any of the proposed concepts have any scope for IP, e.g., is the idea or part of the idea patentable?
  - Phase 3 – Detail Design
    - i.e., can the product be designed in such a way that aspects of it can be patented?

### Intellectual Property
- Intellectual property, often known as IP or IPR, is an intangible asset created by human intellectual or inspirational activity.
- It allows people to own their creativity and innovation in the same way that they can own physical property.
- The owner of the IP can control and be rewarded for its use.
- This might encourage further innovation.


### Intellectual Property Protection
- The majority of protection of Intellectual Property (IP) and IP rights (IPR) only occurs when they have been applied for and granted (i.e., registered rights).
- Some IPR, such as copyright, arises automatically without any registration as soon as there is a record in some form of what has been created (i.e., unregistered rights).

### Main Intellectual Property types
1. Patents for inventions - new and improved products and processes that are capable of industrial application
2. Trademarks for brand identity - of goods and services, allowing distinctions to be made between different traders
3. Designs for product appearance - of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, the lines, contours, colors, shape, texture, or materials of the product itself or its ornamentation
4. Copyright for material - literary and artistic material, music, films, sound recordings and broadcasts, live theatre performances. Include software and multimedia

### What is a Patent?
- A document granting an inventor sole rights to an invention
- A contract between an individual or organization and the state
- A set of exclusive rights granted by a state to a patentee (the inventor or assignee) for a fixed period of time in exchange for the regulated, public disclosure of certain details of a device, method, process, or composition of matter (substance) (known as an invention) which is new, inventive, and useful or industrially applicable

- Granted by government, in exchange for teaching the public new and useful knowledge
- Aims to encourage creativity and innovation within an economy by:
  - Individuals and organizations will know that any idea that is created from their R&D investment will be protected (if patentable), and
  - Any Return On Investment (ROI) will be received by them and not others

- Granted to individuals and organizations who can lay claim to a new product or manufacturing process, or to an improvement of an existing product or process that was not previously known
- The granting of a patent gives the ‘patentee’ a monopoly to make, use, or sell the invention for a fixed period of time
- 20-year protection of potential ROI
- In return for this monopoly, the patentee pays a fee to cover the costs of processing the patent and, equally importantly, publicly discloses details of the invention.

### Patent Requirements
1. Novelty
  - "An invention shall be taken as to be new if it does not form part of the 'state of the art' – the Patent Act 1977 section 2(1) (UK)"
  - A state of the art is defined as "all matter, in other words, publications, written or oral or even anticipated which will render a patent invalid"
  - If you publish your idea before applying for a patent, you are unlikely to be granted a patent

2. Inventive step (non-obvious)
   - "An invention shall be taken to involve an inventive step when it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art"
   - UK Patent Act, section 3
   - It must be clear that progress in the form of invention has taken place

3. Industrial application (useful)
   - The invention shall be taken to be capable of industrial application if it can be a machine, product, or process
   - Patents are about products/processes and therefore the final aim is industrial application (unlike, for example, PhD research)
