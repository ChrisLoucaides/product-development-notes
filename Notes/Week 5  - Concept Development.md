## Phase 1: Concept Development
![[Pasted image 20240513175443.png]]

- The needs of the target market are identified.
- Alternative product concepts are generated and evaluated.
- One or more concepts are selected for further development and testing.
- A concept is a description of the form, function, and features of a product.
- Evaluation and screening criteria are used to aid in the selection.
- Usually accompanied by a set of specifications, an analysis of competitive products, and an economic justification for the project.

- Phase 1 is also known as the "front-end process."
- This phase is very rarely sequential, with many iterations happening through the front-end activities and overlap between them.
- At almost any stage, new information may become available or results learned which can cause the team to step back to repeat an earlier activity before proceeding.


### Identifying customer needs
- The first activity involved in the concept development process is identifying customer needs.
- The goal is to understand customers' needs and then effectively communicate them to the development team.
- The output of this step is customer need statements organized in a hierarchical list, with importance weightings for many or all of the needs.

There are 5 steps to this process
1. Gather raw data from customers.
2. Interpret the raw data in terms of customer needs.
3. Organize the needs into a hierarchy of needs.
4. Establish the relative importance of the needs.
5. Reflect on the results and the process.

#### Step 1 - Gather Raw Data
- Collection of primary/secondary data.
- Primary data: comes from direct contact with customers, buyers, users, or other actors within the marketing system.
- Secondary data: not collected directly by their user, nor are they specific to the user, e.g., existing general reports on a particular market; although easy and cheap to obtain, have limited value.
- Data may be qualitative and/or quantitative.
- Marketing studies often start with a review of secondary data. This can form a basis for designing and carrying out the more difficult and expensive primary data collection.

**Primary data methodologies**
- Interviews: One or more development team members discuss with a single customer.
  - Advantage: interaction with customer.
- Focus groups: A moderator facilitates a two-hour discussion with a group of 8 or 12 customers.
  - Advantage: systematic, retrievable.
  - Disadvantage: costly, time-consuming, not as effective as interviews.
- Observing the product in use.
  - Advantage: effective.
  - Disadvantage: not structured, not systematic.
- Surveys: direct mail or web-based questionnaires.

**Concept Research**
- Develop decision-making strategies.
- Examine existing market segments.
- Understand shopping habits.
- Understand the customers’ view of the products available.
- Look at customers’ beliefs/expectations.
- Analyze current buying patterns.
- Carry out a SWOT/PESTEL analysis.


#### Step 2 - Interpret raw data in terms of customer needs
- Express the customers’ needs in terms of what the product has to do, not in terms of how it might do.
- Use positive, not negative phrasing.
- Express the needs as attributes of the product.
![[Pasted image 20240513180429.png]]

- Structure the needs into:
  - Must-haves – "I won't buy without."
  - Delighters – "What an unexpected treat."
  - Linear Satisfiers – "The more, the merrier."
  - Neutrals – "No big deal."
- This is the Kano classification.
- Consumer needs can be very elusive.
- Intuitions are often wrong.

e.g. Coffee Machine: ![[Pasted image 20240513180531.png]]


##### Customers and their needs
The key to successful market research for new product development comes from an understanding of what customers value and not simply from asking them to submit their own solutions

- Consumers may or may not be able to articulate their needs.
- Consumers may or may not know what will satisfy them.

![[Pasted image 20240513180649.png]]


#### Step 4 - Establish the relative importance of the needs
- Measuring preference is central to market research:
  - Do consumers prefer glass bottles or plastic bottles?
  - Would consumers pay 35p more for a plastic bottle?
  - What is ‘more important’ in yogurt: taste or texture?
  - What proportion of consumers would be willing to have the weight of their laptop increased by 50% in order to double the processing speed?
  - Would the customer’s value of a feature justify the cost of producing it?

#### Step 5 - Reflect on the results and the process
- No process is an exact science.
- It is important to look back over the results and see how effective the process was.
- Questions to ask include:
  - Have we interacted with all important customers in our target market?
  - Can we see the latent needs of customers beyond our current product range?
  - Can we further involve any of the customers in our product development?
  - Did we involve the right people in our organization?
  - Can we improve our process?

### Establishing target specifications
- Specifications provide a precise description of what a product has to do.
- They are a translation of the customer needs into technical terms.
- The output of this stage is:
  - A list of target specifications.
  - Each specification consists of a metric, and marginal and ideal values for that metric.

![[Pasted image 20240513184521.png]]

Here are the four steps of the process:

1. Prepare the list of metrics, i.e. the technical or manufacturing features of the product based on the customer needs.
2. Collect competitive benchmarking information.
3. Set ideal and marginally acceptable target values.
4. Reflect on the results and the process.

- The goal of concept generation is to thoroughly explore the space of product concepts that may address the customer needs.
- Concept generation includes a mix of external search, creative problem-solving within the team, and systematic exploration.
- The result of this activity is usually a set of 10-20 concepts, each typically represented by a sketch and a brief description.

- Concept generation can be a complex problem.
- One approach is to break the problem into simpler subproblems and then look for solutions to these subproblems.
- The sub-problem solutions are then integrated into a total solution.
- This approach allows for the generation of multiple possible concepts.

### Concept Testing
- Concept testing involves presenting the product concept to target consumers and gauging their reactions to weed out poor ideas.
- Prototypes, whether symbolic or physical, can be utilized for this purpose, with closer resemblance to the final product resulting in more dependable testing.
- Increasingly, virtual reality is employed for concept testing, utilizing sensory devices to simulate reality.

There are 5 stages to the screening and evaluation process:
1. Initial screen, entry screen, or preliminary screen.
2. Customer screen.
3. Technical screen.
4. Final screen.
5. Business analysis.

#### 1. Screening and Evaluating
- The key evaluation criteria given in the table on the previous slides can be developed further using a scoring model or weighted checklist.
- Each factor is scored on a scale; a relative weight given to the importance of that factor is used as a multiple, and the weighted scores for all factors are added.
- The ideas/concepts with the highest scores will move forward to the next stage.
- Those with low scores will be discarded or stored in an ideas database for future consideration and development.

#### 2. Customer screen
- Screening continues with customer screening.
- Conduct informal discussions with customers to explain a concept.
- Prototypes serve as useful discussion and explanation tools, particularly with non-technical or end-user customers.

#### 3. Technical screen
Technical screen, technical testing can range from
- Conduct informal technical discussions with experts.
- Consider extensive analysis by a third party, such as an independent consultant, to provide a non-biased view considering the external environment and state of the art.

#### 4. Final screen
- Involves the use of screening models and computer assessment programs
- Weightings given, scoring, etc., done at this stage
- Further development of that undertaken at stage 1 of screening

#### 5. Business analysis
- May involve construction of:
  - Preliminary marketing plans
  - Technical plans
  - Financial reviews
  - Projected budgets
- Potentially new problems are identified at this stage, but this is beneficial as it avoids unnecessary investment


- One or more concepts are then tested to:
  - Verify that the customer needs have been met
  - Assess the market potential of the product
  - Identify any shortcomings that need further development
- If customer response is poor, then the project may be terminated or some earlier activities repeated

### Setting final specifications
- Target specifications are revisited after a concept has been selected and tested
- The team must commit to specific values of the metrics reflecting:
  - The constraints inherent in the product concept
  - Limitations identified through technical modeling
  - Trade-offs between cost and performance

![[Pasted image 20240513190221.png]]

### Concept Development – Project planning
- The final activity of concept development involves:
  - The team creating a detailed development schedule
  - Devising a strategy to minimize development time
  - Identifying the resources required to complete the project

### Concept Development - Contract book
- The Contract book contains:
  - Mission statement
  - Customer needs
  - Details of the selected concept
  - Product specifications
  - Economic analysis of the product
  - Development schedule
  - Project staffing
  - Budget

### Phase 1 – Ongoing activities
![[Pasted image 20240513190338.png]]

- This model is used to:
  - Justify continuation of the overall development program
  - Resolve specific trade-offs among development costs and manufacturing costs
- This is one of the ongoing activities in the concept development phase
- The initial economic analysis is done before the project commences
- It is updated as new information becomes available


### Benchmarking & modelling
- Benchmarking of competitive products
- An understanding of competitive products
- Can be a rich source of ideas for the product and production process design
- Modeling and prototyping
- Every stage of development process involves various forms of models and prototypes
